OpenCPN plugins project README
===============================

This project is currently in an utterly experimental state. It is
aimed to be an important groundwork for the proposed plugin installer [1].

The project exports the fundamental pieces required to install a plugin using
the new installer: The plugin catalogue `ocpn-plugins.xml` and the plugin
icons in the `icons/` directory.

Dependencies
------------

  - python >= 3.4
  - GNU make (optional)


Fast track: creating a modified ocpn-plugins.xml
------------------------------------------------

Windows users need to fix the deps. First install chocolatey as described
at https: //chocolatey.org. Then install the deps:

    > choco install python
    > choco install make
    > choco install git

Drop new or modified xml files in the metadata/ directory. Then do

    > python tools/ocpn-metadata generate --userdir metadata --destfile ocpn-plugins.xml

This will create ocpn-plugins.xml in current directory. As an alternative, use

    > python tools/ocpn-metadata generate --userdir metadata

which installs the xml file in the user data directory where it will override 
whatever file opencpn was installed with. You might want to add
```--version``` to mark the generated file with a new version.

A third option is to just use `make` which creates a ocpn-plugins.xml in 
current directory.


Fast track: Checking URL's used in ocpn-plugins.xml
------------------------------------------------

    > python tools/ocpn-metadata-urls [path]  path assumed is to ocpn-plugins.xml
	

Fast track: Batch Files to use the above commands
------------------------------------------------

    > check.bat   - to be run from the "plugins" directory

    > runcheck.bat   - to be run from the "tools" directory


Developer info

Here is also mer elaborated instructions to create ocpn-plugins.xml if the
fast track fails.
